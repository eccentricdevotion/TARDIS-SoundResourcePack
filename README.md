# TARDIS-Sounds

A TARDIS based resource pack for the [TARDIS](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tardis/) Bukkit plugin. This pack provides the sounds to make your TARDIS sound like the real deal.

## Installation

The resource pack zip file is hosted on the TARDIS Jenkins server, and is refreshed everytime a change is pushed to this repository. [http://tardisjenkins.duckdns.org:8080/job/TARDIS-SoundResourcePack/](http://tardisjenkins.duckdns.org:8080/job/TARDIS-SoundResourcePack/)

## Alternate installation and keeping up-to-date

As the TARDIS resource packs are shared in GitHub repositories. If you install a GitHub client, you can easily keep your resource packs current by syncing with any changes that are pushed to the repository.

Here's a quick run down on doing that:

1. Download and install the GitHub client for your operating system:
   * [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/)
   * [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
2. Start GitHub client and create a free GitHub account (if you don’t have one)
3. In your web browser, navigate to the TARDIS resource pack repositories
